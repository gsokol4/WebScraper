Develop a NodeJS application that scrape data from two websites (Website A and Website B)
using Puppeteer.
Requirements:
● Create a base class named WebsiteCrawler with the following methods:
○ openBrowser(): This method opens a headless Chrome browser using
Puppeteer.
○ goToPage(url): This method navigates the browser to the given URL.
○ closeBrowser(): This method closes the browser instance.
● Create two child classes named WebsiteAScraper and WebsiteBScraper that extend the
WebsiteCrawler class.
● Implement specific methods in each child class to extract the following details from their
respective websites:
○ WebsiteAScraper:
■ Title of the current page
■ List of product names on the page
■ Price of each product
○ WebsiteBScraper:
■ Author of the latest blog post
■ Title of the latest blog post
■ Number of comments on the post

● Use CSS selectors to locate and extract the desired data from each website.
● Ensure proper error handling and logging throughout the program.
● Finally, write a script that creates instances of both scrapers, calls their methods to fetch
data, and stores the extracted information in a structured format (e.g., JSON, CSV).
Bonus points:
● Implement pagination support to scrape multiple pages on each website.
● Add functionality to search a website from the home page.
● Integrate error handling mechanisms to retry fetching data on failures.
● Write unit tests for your scraper classes.
Tips:
● You can use freely available websites for this challenge, like product listing pages or blog
websites.
● Choose websites with different structures and data formats to showcase adaptability.
● Focus on clean code, proper class design, and efficient data extraction strategies.
● Provide a clear readme file explaining the code structure and functionality.
Provide the project within a zip file via email (you can send back a link to a Google Drive share
that contains the zip file for download).
Any use of LLMs (e.g. ChatGPT) to solve the challenge is not allowed, and if detected,
would disqualify the challenge.
